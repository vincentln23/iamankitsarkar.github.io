###By : Ankit Sarkar, Andrew Zhang, Vincent Nguyenkhoa, and Junne Zhu
An actionpacked shooter game where the player controls the monkey with a machinegun and destroys coconuts to gain points. The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible before being hit by a coconut.

###Background
A monkey, Tyrone, is equipped with a machine gun stationed on the far left side of the screen. He is shooting coconuts at incoming evil monkeys trying to steal Tyrone's well earned bananas. Tyrone mercilessly defends his bananas with his life. The objective of the game is to assist Tyrone in protecting his bananas.

Use the up and down arrows to move Tyrone up and down the screen and use the space key to operate his machine gun.
Good Luck and Have Fun!
